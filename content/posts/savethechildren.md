Save the Children is a global charity working to improve the lives of children and families in 118 countries around the world.

To fund their vital work they have over 500 bank accounts with dozens of different international banks. These bank accounts all prepare statements in different formats and today it is a manual job to transform bank statement information into a common format so the charity can make global reports.

The manual data transformation uses up valuable staff time and resources, directly reducing the support the charity is able to give to people who need help. Because the work is so time-consuming, there is little visibility centrally and bank interest is lost because the cash isn't in long-term accounts.

None of this is great, but there is some good news! YOU can join a Hackathon team to solve this problem. We want to build a tool which will convert these statements in the blink of an eye. The amazing Danail Georgiev has already seen a bit of the solution but we want to make something better, faster, smarter and with added Xoomworks sexiness! Will you join us to have fun with amazing colleagues, learn some new skills and help Save the Children make the world a better place?
