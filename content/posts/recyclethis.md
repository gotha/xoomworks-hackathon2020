Build an app that can help people decide if a package / material can be recycled, and which bin to throw it.

In many countries recycling is still not that common yet, and people are still learning how to separate trash. In our own office it’s been very common someone to ask “where should I throw this?”. 

This app would help with this issue. It can have some of these features:
- Being able to scan package signs for recycling type, and get a info where to put it;
- Being able to manually choose from different type of trash & get info where it’s best to throw it;
- Getting local info – what trash is recycled in the area & what’s the bin colors for this trash;
- Have some gamification to boast motivation.
- Possible interaction with business to get material awards for becoming greener.
