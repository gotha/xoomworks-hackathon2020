## When & Where

As we celebrate 5 years of Xoomworks in Bulgaria we would like to invite all employees to participate in the Hackathon on 24th Jan 2020 in our office - Vasil Levski 15-16 blvd. 

The event will start at 10 AM.

## Change the world 

The motto of the Hackathon is "Change the world!".

We know this is ambitious task, but we belive everyone of us can contribute to the betterment of our surroundings.

No matter if it is a project that changes your day to day work, something that improves the product of your client, or an app that influences elections, we will be happy to take a look.
