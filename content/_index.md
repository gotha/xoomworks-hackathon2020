## When & Where

To celebrate our 5 years of Xoomworks in Bulgaria we would like to invite all employees to participate in a Hackathon on 24th Jan 2020 in our office - floor 5, 15-17 Vasil Levski blvd, Sofia.

The event shall start formally at 9:00 AM.  Feel free to come in at whatever time you feel it’s reasonable and allowing you to show best your efforts.

There will be banitzas for the early birds in the morning and pizzas for lunch!

## Change the world 

The motto of the Hackathon is “Change the world!".
We know this is ambitious task, but we believe everyone of us can contribute to the betterment of our surroundings.

Whatever you choose - a project that changes your day-to-day work, something that improves the product of your client, or an app that influences elections, we will be happy to take a look.


Everyone feel free to add more ideas to this list or join an existing team. Check out the Projects below!

## What’s in it for me

You shall feel part of something challenging, dynamic and exciting. You shall have the opportunity to learn new things, exchange ideas and demonstrate your professional abilities.

The winners shall get a special prize...

Good luck to everyone participating one way or another!
