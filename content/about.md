It is all about having fun. 

Hackatons are intended to bring out your creative side by removing all constraints and giving you the opportunity to innovate.

We want to create an event where everyone can show us a glimpse of their vision of a better world. Event if it is not completely finished, it is the intention that counts.

Prove that your idea is the best and you'll the chance to hatch and develop it into a real product that will positively affect other people's lives.

Think outside the box (or inside, idk, I am not your mom).
