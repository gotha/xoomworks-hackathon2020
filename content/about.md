It is all about having fun. 

Hackatons are intended to bring out your creative side by removing all contraints and giving you the opportunity to innovate.

We want to create an event where everyone can show us a glimpse of their vission of a better world. Event if it is not completely finished, it is the intention that counts.

If you prove to have the best idea there will be a chance to mature it and develop it into a real product that will positively affect other people's lives.

Think outside the box (or inside, idk, I am not your mom).
