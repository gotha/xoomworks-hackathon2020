1. Have fun

	Don't forget to have fun while chaning the world. 

	Try to be inclusive and involve everyone in your great idea. Preaching about how cool your project is increases your chances to win.

1. Teams

	Team size should be between 1 and 5 members. We have a strict policy agains teams without members. 
	You can participate in more than one team. 

1. Source code

	You can do your research, but please do not prepare source code before the event.
	We encourage the use of third party and open source libraries, but at the day of the event you should start on a blank canvas. 

1. Mocking 

	It is impossible to create a full featured product in a few hours. Think about what makes your project unique and focus on it, everything else can be replaced with visually appealing mocks. 

1. Harassment

	Do not insult, follow, stalk or try to intimidate Hackathon particpants (or anyone, now that I think about it). 
	If you see inapropriate behaviour, say something.
